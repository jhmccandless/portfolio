        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Howdy! I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with skills honed through
          DigitalCrafts. Though currently working full time as an Oilfield
          Chemist, I hope to break out of my current scientific role and into a
          position in the technical field
        </p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          The DigitalCrafts bootcamp has taught a plethera of technical skills
          but my computer language discovery journey began a year before with a
          Udemy course about Javascript. Though lacking job experience in the
          technical industry, I have four and half years of experience in the
          workforce as a Chemist. This experience indludes professionalism,
          organization, and task management both individually and within a team.
          Also, with a large amount of work in hospitatly, I possess customer
          service skills that make me easy to work with not only around
          coworkders and supervisors, but including potential clients as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I have an understanding of a developer's technical skill set from
          basic frontend Javascript, HTML5, and CSS all through backend working
          with Node.js, NPM, and postgreSQL. React and Redux round of my
          technical skills to prepare me for a blossoming career as a Software
          Engineer!
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        >
        <p>
          This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Javascript,
          HTML, and CSS. Working solo on this project meant the not only the
          design, but the logic had to be figured out myself. Though simple,
          this early project gave a taste of how much one can do with
          Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

          >Death in the Afternoon</a
        >
        <p>
          This application is designed as a point-of-sale system with a set
          group of cocktails imported from an API. One chooses one of the six
          drinks and is them redirected to the drink informatin page. After
          seeing the drink details and confirming this is the desired drink, you
          can add the drink and go to the cart page where the order is totaled.
          As a group project, jobs were divied out from person to person with my
          main job focusing on the second, drink detail page. I also had a large
          responsibility in the way the application visually looks. Other,
          smaller jobs included helping the team with problem solving issues as
          well as leading meetings to be sure tasks were handled and completed.
          We used not only the fundamental Javascript, CSS, and HTML, but also
          axios to hanlde the API calls as well as local storage to pass the
          information form page to page as the user clicks through.

          >kCalorie</a
        >
        <p>
          Since the world does not have enough tracking applications, here is
          another one that tracks calories one eats throughout the day. This
          application not only tracks the calories, but also gives some
          statistics about the calories including the amount consumed over a
          7-day period and and average calories per day and per meal. The design
          and logic behind the application came from me as this project I worked
          alone on. We used Node.js and PostgreSQL to interact with the backend.
          Middleware made the login page functional by using Github credentials
          that are then stored and used to create a personalized dashboard and
          detail page with data from that one user's input. Not only were
          Node.js and PostgreSQL used in this application, but Javascript, HTML
          and CSS were used as well.
